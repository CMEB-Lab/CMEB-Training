# Clinical Standards & ISO 15189 Compliance Training Manual (Module 2.7)

A 16-hour, competency-based program to master quality management, validation, and accreditation requirements for clinical bioinformatics under ISO 15189, essential for diagnostic laboratories and technical interviews.

## Learning Objectives

By completion, learners will be able to:

1. Map bioinformatics processes to ISO 15189 clauses on validation, documentation, and quality assurance.
2. Design audit-ready Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for key NGS workflows.
3. Implement traceability, data integrity checks, and version control to satisfy regulatory requirements.
4. Prepare evidence dossiers and participate in external quality assessment (EQA) schemes.

## Day 1 (4 hours): Introduction to ISO 15189 & Quality Management

### 1.1 Overview of ISO 15189 (1 hour)

- Scope and structure of the standard: management requirements (clauses 4.x) vs. technical requirements (clauses 5.x).
- Key principles: competence, impartiality, continual improvement, and risk management.


### 1.2 Quality Management System (QMS) Concepts (1 hour)

- Document control, record control, and change management.
- Nonconformance handling, corrective/preventive action (CAPA), and management review.


### 1.3 Mapping Bioinformatics Workflows (2 hours)

- Identify critical processes: sample receipt, data processing, variant calling, reporting.
- Create a process flowchart and link each step to applicable ISO 15189 clauses (e.g., 5.5 “examination procedures,” 5.6 “assuring quality of examination results”).


#### Hands-on Exercise

1. Draft a high-level process map for RNA-seq differential expression analysis.
2. Annotate each node with the ISO 15189 clause(s) it satisfies.

## Day 2 (4 hours): Standard Operating Procedures & Validation

### 2.1 SOP Structure and Content (1 hour)

- Sections: purpose, scope, responsibilities, materials, procedure, safety, records.
- Template review and best practices.


### 2.2 Analytical Validation Plan (1 hour)

- Performance characteristics: accuracy, precision (repeatability/reproducibility), limit of detection, specificity, linearity.
- Define acceptance criteria and validation matrix.


### 2.3 Hands-on: SOP Drafting (2 hours)

- Write an SOP for “Alignment and quantification of RNA-seq data.” Include:
    - Version history and document control footer.
    - Stepwise protocol with commands (e.g., STAR two-pass, Salmon quant).
    - Validation checks (e.g., minimum mapping rate ≥ 85%, QC thresholds).


## Day 3 (4 hours): Traceability, Data Integrity & Version Control

### 3.1 Traceability Requirements (1 hour)

- Unique sample identifiers, audit trails, and electronic records.
- Data lifecycle: raw FASTQ → aligned BAM → quantification outputs → final reports.


### 3.2 Data Integrity Checks (1 hour)

- File checksums (MD5/SHA-256) and hash-based verification.
- Logging mechanisms and immutable storage.


### 3.3 Git-Based Version Control for Compliance (2 hours)

- Repository structure: separate branches for development, validation, and release.
- Tagging validated releases; protecting release branches.
- Commit messages and change logs as audit evidence.


#### Hands-on Exercise

1. Create a Git repo skeleton with protected `main` (release) and `validation` branches.
2. Commit a pipeline script, generate its SHA-256 checksum, and add validation metadata to a JSON manifest.

## Day 4 (4 hours): External Quality Assessment & Continual Improvement

### 4.1 External Quality Assessment (EQA) Schemes (1 hour)

- Overview: CAP, EMQN, UK NEQAS; sample distribution, result submission, performance scoring.
- Internal vs. external proficiency testing.


### 4.2 Continual Improvement Cycle (1 hour)

- Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) for bioinformatics pipelines.
- Key performance indicators (KPIs): turnaround time, error rates, audit findings.


### 4.3 Hands-on: EQA Dossier Preparation (2 hours)

- Prepare a mock EQA submission package:
    - SOP excerpts, validation summary, QC metrics, result reports.
    - CAPA log for identified deviations and corrective actions.


## Assessment Framework
