# Capstone Project & Interview Drills Training Manual (Module 2.8)

A 16-hour, competency-based culmination that consolidates all preceding modules into a real-world capstone and hones technical-interview readiness through targeted drills.

## Learning Objectives

By completion, learners will be able to:

1. Execute an end-to-end RNA-seq pipeline from raw FASTQ through differential expression in a reproducible, containerized workflow.
2. Produce production-grade deliverables: code repository with CI tests, container image, interactive report, and manuscript-style write-up.
3. Demonstrate core bioinformatics competencies under interview conditions: file-format parsing, algorithmic thinking, statistical reasoning, and Git conflict resolution.

## Week 1: Capstone Project Development (10 hours)

### Day 1–2: Project Setup & Data Acquisition (4 hours)

**1. Select Public Dataset**

- Choose an RNA-seq study (e.g., ENA/SRA accession with ≥ 4 samples per condition).
- Download FASTQ and metadata via `prefetch` or `fastq-dl` into `data/raw/`.

**2. Repository Scaffold**

```bash
mkdir -p capstone/{data,scripts,results,workflow,docs}
cd capstone
git init
echo “capstone project” > README.md
git add . && git commit -m “chore: initialize capstone scaffold”
```

- Create `environment.yml`, `workflow/Snakefile`, and placeholder RMarkdown report in `docs/`.


### Day 3–4: Pipeline Implementation (4 hours)

**1. Snakemake Workflow**

- **Rules**:
    - `download`: fetch FASTQ.
    - `qc`: FastQC → MultiQC.
    - `align`: STAR two-pass → sorted BAM.
    - `quant`: Salmon quant.
    - `de`: DESeq2 differential expression.
    - `report`: render RMarkdown.

**2. Containerization**

- Build Docker image: include all tools (FastQC, STAR, Salmon, R ≥ 4.2, Python 3.9).
- Test:

```bash
docker build -t capstone:latest .
docker run —rm capstone:latest snakemake —cores 4 —use-conda
```


### Day 5: Deliverables & Documentation (2 hours)

**1. Interactive Report**

- RMarkdown in `docs/report.Rmd`:
    - Executive summary.
    - QC summaries, alignment stats, TPM heatmap, MA/volcano plots, GO enrichment.
    - Parameter tables and session info.

**2. Manuscript-Style Write-Up**

- `docs/manuscript.md`: background, methods (pipeline steps), results, discussion, conclusions, and future directions.

**3. CI Tests**

- GitHub Actions:
    - **Lint**: `snakemake —lint`.
    - **Test**: run small subsampled dataset (`data/sample`) through full workflow.
    - **Report**: upload MultiQC HTML as artifact.


## Week 2: Interview Drills & Competency Checks (6 hours)

### Session 1: File-Format Parsing Drills (1.5 hours)

- **Prompt 1**: Write a Bash one-liner to extract chromosome 1 variants from a compressed VCF (`.vcf.gz`).
- **Prompt 2**: In Python, parse a FASTQ file and output per-read length distribution to CSV.
- **Evaluation**: time ≤ 15 min; correct handling of headers, compression, edge cases.


### Session 2: Algorithmic & Statistical Thinking (1.5 hours)

- **Rosalind-style Problems**:
    - Compute k-mer spectrum from FASTA.
    - Given count matrix, implement edgeR’s TMM normalization in R from scratch.
- **Whiteboard Pseudocode**:
    - Design an algorithm to merge overlapping BED intervals.


### Session 3: Git & Collaboration Drills (1 hour)

- **Conflict Resolution**: Simulate two branches modifying the same Snakefile rule; resolve merge conflict via rebase.
- **Version Tagging**: Tag v1.0 for validated run; update changelog.


### Session 4: Live Coding & Debugging (1.5 hours)

- **Live Task**: Given a failing pipeline step (`quant.sf` missing), debug the Snakemake rule and propose a fix.
- **Explanation**: Articulate error-handling strategy and logging improvements.


### Session 5: Behavioral & Values Alignment (0.5 hour)

- **Scenario**: You encounter unexpected low mapping rates in clinical samples.
    - Describe steps to investigate, document findings, and escalate under ISO 15189.
    - Demonstrate alignment with integrity, accountability, and continual improvement.


## Assessment Rubric

| Area | Beginner | Intermediate | Advanced |
| :— | :— | :— | :— |
| **Pipeline Execution** | Pipeline runs end-to-end | Reproducible via container & CI | Optimized, parameterized, cloud/HPC-ready |
| **Code & Documentation** | Functional scripts & comments | Structured repo, SOPs, RMarkdown report | Elegant modular code, comprehensive tutorial, publication-ready |
| **Technical Drills** | Correct solutions under guidance | Solve independently within time limits | Extend solutions, explain trade-offs, handle edge cases |
| **Version Control & CI** | Basic commits & tags | Automated CI tests & linting | Advanced workflows: matrix builds, docker-registry deploy |
| **Professional Judgment** | Aware of QC metrics | Proposes corrective actions | Integrates regulatory compliance, risk mitigation, PDCA |

**Biblical Foundation:** “Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord” (Colossians 3:23). This rigorous capstone and interview preparation reflect diligent stewardship of your gifts, ensuring excellence in both code and character.
