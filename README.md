# CMEB-Training

At CMEB Lab CityUHK, our mission is to provide comprehensive resources and clear, engaging science communication to support the bioinformatics community. 


Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field at the intersection of biology, computer science, and data science - requiring a diverse skillset.

Additionally, as individuals from each of these backgrounds (BMS / EE) can equally be interested in the field. As a result, training resources need to be able to provide sufficient training on several core areas before you are able to dive in. 

This repository is a central hub for bioinformatics training and resources for students and researchers from across diverse backgrounds. Whether you’re a student or researcher you’ll find valuable information, tutorials, and insights to help you navigate the complex field.

When beginning in bioinformatics, there is a bit of a learning curve that may seem daunting initially as you need to be familiar with the fundamentals of both biology and computer science. In fact, it is often the case that no matter which one of these backgrounds an individual has, they often feel intimidated by the other topic. However, no matter how complex these topics can be at the extremes, the basics required for bioinformatics are easily accessible for the vast majority of students. In fact it’s often the case that people just don’t know where to begin. In this training resource, we cover the absolute essential information from each of these fields assuming no prior knowledge of the subjects. In this way, no matter your background, you will be able to start making meaningful progress towards understanding bioinformatics.

## Chatbot Coaching

We have developed a [Perplexity Space](https://www.perplexity.ai/spaces/cmeb-training-EdNgSGUKSZqfrI5iqc6vBw) for AI-assistance and interactive learning to guide you on your bioinformatics jouney. You do not need to sign up to perplexity to use the bot, but doing so will allow you to add the Space to your acount so that you can easily access it later.



## Introduction to Biology

If you are a beginner in biology, or just want a refresher, check out our [introduction to biology](Introduction-to-Biology) section.


## Introduction to Coding

If you are a beginner in coding, or just want a refresher, check out our [introduction to coding](Introduction-to-Coding) section.


## Introductory Analyses

This [introductory analysis section](Introductory-Analyses) contains a few tutorials to get you started working with biological data. We have also collected some tutorials that we have vetted and recommend.

## Perplexity Generated Training & Competencies

This [directory](perplexity-generated-training) aims to provide introductory material for 'core competencies' in bioinformatics - that is to say key skills that are of general value to those wishing to work in the field. These were generated with perplexity AI and have not been vetted multiple times by various individuals - therefore there is a chance there may be errors. Please use with caution.
