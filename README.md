# CMEB-Training

At CMEB Lab CityUHK, our mission is to provide comprehensive resources and clear, engaging science communication to support the bioinformatics community. 


Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field at the intersection of biology, computer science, and data science - requiring a diverse skillset.

Additionally, as individuals from each of these backgrounds (BMS / EE) can equally be interested in the field. As a result, training resources need to be able to provide sufficient training on several core areas before you are able to dive in. 

This repository is a central hub for bioinformatics training and resources for students and researchers from across diverse backgrounds. Whether you’re a student or researcher you’ll find valuable information, tutorials, and insights to help you navigate the complex field.


## Chatbot Coaching

We have developde a [Perplexity Space](https://www.perplexity.ai/spaces/cmeb-training-EdNgSGUKSZqfrI5iqc6vBw) for AI-assistance and interactive learning to guide you on your bioinformatics jouney. You do not need to sign up to perplexity to use the bot, but doing so will allow you to add the Space to your acount so that you can easily access it later.
