# Introductory Analyses

In this directory we have a collection of relatively simple bioinformatics analyses which will allow you to become familiar with some of the basic principles of this type of research.



## Methods for Analysing Gene Expression 

In this section we will go over different ways to quantify and compare gene expression across multiple samples and/or conditions.

### Microarray Analysis

This section we will cover how to analyse microarray data. Although this data type is somewhat outdated, the analysis is relatively simple to perform and has very low computational requirements. Additionally, the core principle of the analysis carries over to more recent data types. As a result its a good place to start to understand the basics of gene expression analysis.

### RNA Sequencing Analysis

This section we will provide a simple [introduction to RNA Seq analysis.](Introductory-Analyses/introductory-rna-seq-tutorial)
